Hello Ravelers,

I'm pretty lazy when it comes to updating my WIPs or uploading project photos so I created a "to-do list" which displays WIPs, finished projects without photos, and hibernating projects that really should be frogged or restarted.

Then I added a gallery/slider (jquery plugin) of my finished projects in the bottom so the page would look a little more lively.

Thanks for looking,

Caroline
